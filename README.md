# Passport-Management-System
It is inhouse passport management system website made with the help of XAMPP.
I did it in MSc Sem 2 along with my friends Deborupa Roy, Rishov Nag, Soumik De. This is a inhouse passport management software with 5 types of employees performing different tasks and another admin allocating the employees.
It contains 2 dummy databases which can only be viewed but not modified(dummy passport and dummy aadhar).
The low level officer input the data from the applicants, then the data is verified by Verification officer, Appointment is scheduled by Information Officer and carried on by Interview Officer.If everything is all right with no faulty data then is verified by Police and then sent for print.
